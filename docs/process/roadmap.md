# Roadmap

The following are the larger areas of upcoming work the GitHub Desktop team intends to explore. This is not inclusive of everything we're working on, and it's not written in stone. We'll continue to update it as our priorities evolve.

#### Branch list grows with merged & deleted branches making it difficult to find those you care about (in progress)

- Prune branches after they've been deleted: [#750](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/issues/750)
- Measuring success: N/A for now

#### Users behind corporate proxies cannot clone without manual setup

- Measuring success: TBD alongside the work
